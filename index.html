<h2>Some general life guidelines and rules that made me a happier being:</h2>

<p>Foundational rules for a happy existence:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Friends</li>
  <li>Have Goals</li>
  <li>Have A Life Story</li>
  <li>Money Isn’t The Answer</li>
  <li>Keep Growing</li>
</ol>

<h2>Observations:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Routine is the enemy of time: time is a relative thing. A week filled with new experiences will feel longer than two week of the same routine everyday. Time is valuable, so make it count.</li>
<li>Without a goal, you can’t score: when you don’t have a target it is hard to be satisfied with the work you’ve done. A soccer player can give a great free kick, but if it just ends up bouncing on the grass there is no satisfaction. Imagine the player scoring a great goal. Satisfying isn’t it?</li>
<li>Save time - not money, as money is used to buy back time. A lot of what we do in life is a tradeoff between money and time. You can substitute these two in a lot of ways. When possible, always substitute money for time and try to avoid exchanging time for money</li>
<li>Be more concerned about being interested than being interesting. Being interesting is fun as you get a lot of people to ask you advice about a lot of your experiences. Nevertheless, being interested is what makes you happy, unless you’re a narcist.</li>
<li>Humans design objects trying to beat nature in efficiency and beauty</li>
</ol>

<p>Motivation is fleeting, discipline is not:</p>
<p>No time = no motivation = no priority
The most dangerous thing you can do in life is to play it safe</p>

<p>Dullness => creating/buying/looking for new experiences as they are not present in the daily life. When out of comfort zone: new impulses, new sights, hunger for life is satisfied</p>

<p>Nature satisfies this need for new impulses, therefore man needs nature to be happy</p>

<p>Life: Avoiding pain - seeking pleasure - purpose</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep a to-don't list</li>
  <li>politely learn to say no</li>
  <li>start sooner</li>
  <li>communicate deadlines</li>
  <li>create space to work (physical and time)</li>
</ul>
