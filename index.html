  Some general life guidelines and rules that made me a happier being:

Foundational rules for a happy existence:

1. Friends
2. Have Goals
3. Have A Life Story
4. Money Isn’t The Answer
5. Keep Growing


Observations:

1. Routine is the enemy of time: time is a relative thing. A week filled with new experiences will feel longer than two week of the same routine everyday. Time is valuable, so make it count.

2. Without a goal, you can’t score: when you don’t have a target it is hard to be satisfied with the work you’ve done. A soccer player can give a great free kick, but if it just ends up bouncing on the grass there is no satisfaction. Imagine the player scoring a great goal. Satisfying isn’t it?

3. Save time - not money, as money is used to buy back time. A lot of what we do in life is a tradeoff between money and time. You can substitute these two in a lot of ways. When possible, always substitute money for time and try to avoid exchanging time for money

4. Be more concerned about being interested than being interesting. Being interesting is fun as you get a lot of people to ask you advice about a lot of your experiences. Nevertheless, being interested is what makes you happy, unless you’re a narcist.

5. Humans design objects trying to beat nature in efficiency and beauty

Motivation is fleeting, discipline is not:
No time = no motivation
The most dangerous thing you can do in life is to play it safe

Dullness => creating/buying/looking for new experiences as they are not present in the daily life. When out of comfort zone: new impulses, new sights, hunger for life is satisfied

Nature satisfies this need for new impulses, therefore man needs nature to be happy

Life: Avoiding pain - seeking pleasure - purpose

1 keep a to-don't list
2 politely learn to say no
3 start sooner
4 communicate deadlines
5 create space to work
